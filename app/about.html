                  <p>I am a computer science student originally from Dubuque, Iowa. Currently I am studying at the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, working towards a Masters in Computer Science with a focus in Software Engineering through the 4+1 MCS degree. This program of study has allowed me to pursue my Bachelors in Arts in Computer Science with Honors at the same time that I am pursuing my Masters degree. </p>

                  <p>During my time at the university, I have been a member of ACM as Webmaster and Vice President, WICS as Webmaster and President, and EPX as a developer. </p>

                  <p>As a computer scientist, my interests are software engineering and data analytics, which is reflected in my various projects on GitHub or at my previous internships. </p>

                  <p>In 2016, I was an IT Analyst Intern at John Deere in Moline, Illinois. During this internship, I worked extensively with the Tableau teams to automate the Tableau Server commands. This allowed us to move away from maintaining the Tableau projects ourselves and allowed our consumers to manage their own projects. When I wasn’t working on this project, I was developing Tableau dashboards and scripts for the crontab which would monitor our products’ activity levels. The scripts would not only gather metrics for our dashboards, but would also send out email notifications the second that the server failed to obtain metrics, which allowed us to improve server health. The dashboards themselves were used to inform upper level leadership of usage trends in our applications, easing the process of applying for additional funding or illustrating any trends.</p>

                  <p>In 2017, I was a Customer Core Services Intern at State Farm in Bloomington, Illinois. During this internship, I collaborated with the different Systems teams to develop a Postgres database which I then implemented into the production code. This database was used to store results from an external service call for later reference, which reduced costs of the application through overall reduced service calls. When I wasn’t working on this feature, I programmed several JUnit tests which allowed us to increase our code coverage on several production applications to above 90%. </p>

                  <p>Along with computer science, my other passion is doing outreach events for upcoming bright STEM minds. It is for this reason that I am involved with the STEM outreach programs offered through our university. During these events, we bring NAO robots, Cosmos, and drones to the classroom for at least a day and teach the kids how to program and interact with these technologies.</p>
